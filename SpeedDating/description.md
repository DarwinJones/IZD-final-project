# About This Data

This data was collected by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper *Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.* Data was gathered from 2002-2004 at various speed dating events. Subjects at events were placed in a series of 4-minute long “first dates” with a member of the opposite sex. After these dates, they were asked to rate their partners in 6 areas *(Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests)* and whether they would like to see tham again.
